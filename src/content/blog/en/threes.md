My dear precious Emily,<br>

This August, it will be 3 years,<br>Than you and me we've meet.

3 years spend with an incredible person,<br>3 years of laugh, joy, or even recomfort,<br>Recomfort than you can give so easily,<br>Because you're such a awesome cutie.

Resuming 3 years of friendship in a poem,<br>Will be really not an easy thing to me,<br>But I'll try my best, still in this same poem,<br>To express how much are you someone extraordinary.

You have <i>power</i>.

I know these last couple of months was not easy,<br>It was even like dealing with the hell itself,<br>But, even with all than happened, after all of this,<br>You've succeeded to move on, to still fighting.

You have <i>courage</i>.

Speaking of fighting, you're doing really more than fine,<br>As I've seen you evolved over all of these years,<br>You're so much stronger than before, much combative,<br>Against your weaknesses, and against the bad part of life.

You have <i>wisdom</i>.

Wisdom, a great word than can describe what you are,<br>Being someone who take a lot to take care of others,<br>Being someone who always do their best, even in hard times,<br>With your kindness, sweetness,&nbsp;sympathy... You're such a sister.

You didn't have to farm to your valley,<br>Or beat a bunch of fantasy ennemies,<br>Or even use some sort of pocket monster,<br>And even not seducing some fictional girls,

To have,<br>Power, courage, wisdom,<br>At yourself,<br>You have all of the triforce.

Happy birthday Emily. ðŸ’œ

You're someone very important and precious for me,<br>Someone who helped me a fucking lot in my life,<br>Someone than I can trust in you forever, than helped me a lot to accept who I am today and who take so much care to me.<br>We have so much good time togethers, so moment than I'll never forget. Even if we've tough times sometimes, we've always move on and just... You're so precious.<br>

I love you.
